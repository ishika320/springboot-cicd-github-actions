# Automated Continuous Integration and Deployment System using GitHub Actions and Docker

## 📌 Project Overview
This project implements an automated Continuous Integration and Deployment (CI/CD) system to streamline the software development and delivery process. It uses GitHub Actions to automate the build workflow and Docker to containerize the application, ensuring consistent execution across different environments.

The system automatically triggers whenever code changes are pushed to the GitHub repository, eliminating the need for manual build and deployment steps.

---

## 🚀 Technologies Used
- Java (Spring Boot)
- Git & GitHub
- GitHub Actions
- Docker
- Maven

---

## ⚙️ How the Project Works
1. A developer pushes code to the GitHub repository.
2. GitHub Actions automatically triggers the CI/CD workflow.
3. The application is built using Maven.
4. Tests are executed to ensure code quality.
5. Docker packages the application into a container image.
6. The Docker image is ready for deployment on any environment.

---

## 🐳 Docker Integration
Docker is used to containerize the application along with its dependencies. This ensures that the application runs consistently across development, testing, and production environments without configuration issues.

---

## 🔄 CI/CD Pipeline Features
- Automated build on every code push
- Automated testing
- Docker image creation
- Reduced manual intervention
- Faster and reliable deployments
